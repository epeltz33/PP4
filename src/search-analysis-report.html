    <h2>Performance Analysis Summary</h2>
    <p>The analysis reveals several important findings about the performance characteristics of different search algorithms:</p>

    <p>The initial sequential search on the unsorted array took 13.93 ms, which was the slowest among all search operations. After sorting the array, which took only 0.66 ms, the performance of all search methods improved or changed in interesting ways:</p>

    <p>The sequential search on the sorted array improved significantly, reducing its execution time to 4.56 ms, showing a 67% improvement over the unsorted sequential search. This improvement occurred despite the algorithm remaining fundamentally the same, likely due to improved cache performance with sorted data.</p>

    <p>The iterative binary search proved to be the most efficient method, completing in 3.27 ms. This represents a 76% improvement over the original unsorted sequential search and a 28% improvement over the sorted sequential search.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, the recursive binary search took 9.21 ms, making it slower than both the sorted sequential search and the iterative binary search. This relatively poor performance can be attributed to the overhead of recursive function calls and stack management.</p>

    <p>The consistency in the number of matches (1,000) and sum of matches (5,455,691) across all search methods validates the correctness of all implementations. The minimal time required for sorting (0.66 ms) demonstrates that the overhead of sorting is quickly amortized by the improved search performance, particularly when multiple searches are performed on the same data set.</p>
